## Project Specification

## Overview

An AI-powered knowledge management and writing assistant specifically designed for academic researchers to organize, learn from, and improve their grant applications through iterative feedback analysis.

## Core Features

### 1. Grant Repository & Organization

- **Centralized Storage**: Upload and organize all grant applications, funding call documents, and reviewer feedback
- **Categorization System**: Organize grants by funding organizations (CIHR, clinical funding, etc.) to account for different writing styles and evaluation criteria
- **Version Control**: Track multiple iterations of the same grant through resubmission cycles
- **Document Relationships**: Establish clear connections between grant versions, reviewer comments, and revisions

### 2. Intelligent Feedback Management

- **Comment Prioritization**: Manual flagging system to identify "grant killer" comments vs. minor/ignorable feedback
- **Pattern Recognition**: Visual interface to highlight and categorize reviewer feedback across multiple grants
- **Learning Integration**: AI learns from user's prioritization decisions to better identify critical issues in future grants

### 3. AI Writing Assistant

- **Personalized Learning**: AI adapts to user's specific writing style, tone, and preferences based on historical grant submissions
- **Contextual Assistance**:
  - Early stage: Help draft sections based on one-pager summaries and key points
  - Late stage: Review complete drafts for potential issues and improvement suggestions
- **Repository-Informed Suggestions**: Recommendations based on patterns from user's entire grant history, not just current application

### 4. Knowledge Graph Architecture

- **Relationship Mapping**: Backend system that understands connections between:
  - Grant versions and their iterations
  - Reviewer comments and subsequent revisions
  - Successful vs. unsuccessful applications
  - User's response patterns to different types of feedback

### 5. Analysis & Insights

- **Success Pattern Analysis**: Identify which types of grants perform better/worse
- **Recurring Issue Detection**: Highlight consistent weaknesses across applications
- **Improvement Tracking**: Monitor how addressing specific feedback impacts success rates

## Technical Requirements

### AI/ML Components

- Custom language model fine-tuned on user's writing samples
- Semantic analysis of reviewer feedback
- Pattern recognition across grant applications
- Personalized recommendation engine

### Data Management

- Secure document storage and version control
- Metadata tagging and categorization
- Search and retrieval functionality
- Export capabilities for grant applications

### User Interface

- Intuitive grant organization dashboard
- Comment highlighting and flagging tools
- Chat-based AI interaction
- Visual pattern recognition displays

## Target Market

- Academic researchers (postdocs, professors)
- Research institutions
- Grant writing consultants
- Potential expansion to funding agencies for review assistance

## Value Proposition

- **Time Savings**: Reduce grant writing time through AI assistance and organized knowledge base
- **Success Rate Improvement**: Learn from past feedback to avoid recurring issues
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Never lose track of previous grant ideas and reviewer insights
- **Personalized Learning**: AI that understands individual writing style and research patterns

## Pricing Strategy

- Subscription-based model targeting $50/month for individual researchers
- Institutional licensing for universities and research organizations
